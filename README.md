# CatGame
A cat game I created to get better at JavaScript.

To run, put all files in a folder and open 'catGameUpdated' file in a Chrome browser.  To play press 'START', choose difficulty level, and then try to swipe all of the cats - cats can be clicked, touched, or moused over.  You get three lives and there are a total of four levels.  Good luck!
